# 🎓 Student Mental Health & Performance Analysis System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the intersection of **Educational Data Mining** and **Mental Health Analytics**. Utilizing Machine Learning algorithms, this application analyzes the impact of psychological factors (Depression, Anxiety, Panic Attacks) on academic performance (CGPA).

This is an **End-to-End AI Solution** featuring an interactive dashboard for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and a Predictive Model to estimate student grades based on their mental well-being profile.

## 🚀 Features
* **Predictive Modeling:** Uses `Random Forest Regressor` to predict CGPA with high precision.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Built with **Streamlit** offering a "Glassmorphism" UI design.
* **Data Visualization:** Advanced 3D Scatter plots, Pie charts, and Correlation heatmaps using **Plotly**.
* **Explainable Insights:** Identifies key stressors affecting student performance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.9+
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Plotly Express

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes parameters such as:
* **Academic:** CGPA, Year of Study, Course.
* **Demographic:** Gender, Age, Marital Status.
* **Psychological:** Depression (Yes/No), Anxiety (Yes/No), Panic Attacks (Yes/No).
